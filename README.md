JavaScript - HTML - ScSS

A small website created to browser all free games available at the moment in a sleek simple interface.

- This website was created to learn mostly about fetching data with Axios and incorporating smooth and simple eye catching animations for a video game like feel.

#### I used the Free to Play Games Database API located [here](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc)
