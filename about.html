				<h2>Things used:</h2>
				<ul class="tech">
					<details>
						<summary>HTML</summary>
						<p>
							Was used to create the content on page and attempting to use as many as possible appropriate semantic HTML tags. For example used details and summary for this one here (no Javascript sorcery involed here!)
						</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>CSS/SCSS</summary>
						<p>
							To layout and style everything and also got even better handling on my margin handling as well as taking a mobile first approach on this one for the design.
						</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>Vanilla Javascript</summary>
						<p>
							Dynamically displayed items and created html elements on the fly with the new things learned. I also had a lot of fun learning to scroll the user's screen smoothly.
						</p>
					</details>
					<details>
						<summary>API</summary>
						<p>
							Fetched from Free to Game Database API from <a href=https://rapidapi.com/digiwalls/api/free-to-play-games-database/">RapidAPI</a> their official website is <a href="FreeToGame.com">FreeToGame.com</a>. Learning to fetch APIs was the main reason I created this project. But I learned a lot more than just that. Such as smooth scrolls and stronger Js function flow control.
						</p> 
					</details>
